# 🤖 Ultron – Personal AI Assistant

Ultron is a voice-enabled personal AI assistant that interacts with users through speech and text. It supports basic system commands, intelligent conversations, and real-time text-to-speech responses, wrapped in a custom personality layer for engaging interactions.

The assistant uses a modular design with rule-based logic for common tasks and falls back to a local large language model for advanced responses.
